    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>The Elects Apostolic Church (TEAC) was founded in 1952 by <i>Tata</i> George Dashe during a time when African spirituality 
    was poorly understood and disinterest in it had reached its zenith. The relationship between indigenous people 
    and their angels (<i>abokhokho</i>) was severely lacking, and African roots and spirituality had been forsaken. <i>Tata</i> Dashe 
    established TEAC under the guidance of his angels, who recognized the urgent need to bridge the gap between individuals and their
    celestial guardians (<i>abokhokho</i>).</p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <p>A celestial guardian refers to a spiritual being or angelic figure that provides guidance, protection, and support
    to individuals on their spiritual journeys. These guardians bridge the gap between the earthly realm and the divine, 
    helping individuals deepen their understanding of their own divinity, spirituality, and strengthen their connection to 
    their roots and heritage. In the framework of The Elects Apostolic Church, celestial guardians play a crucial role in
    facilitating a relationship between people and their spiritual heritage; thus promoting growth, healing, and enlightenment.
    At the time of founding, the community was committed to various religions. To accommodate this diversity, <i>Tata</i> Dashe 
    chose to hold services on Saturday evenings, allowing his disciples to continue their religious practices while 
    simultaneously deepening their understanding of African spirituality and themselves.</p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <p>In 1992, <i>Tata</i> Dashe informed his disciples that his journey was nearing its end, causing great concern among those
    who followed his teachings, as they felt they had much to learn from him and that their spiritual journeys were still
    in their infancy. To ease their unease, <i>Tata</i> Dashe assured them that they would not lack his teachings or guidance, 
    for he would live on through his son. He emphasized that his son would continue to lead and inspire them. Those who 
    followed <i>Tata</i> George Dashe continue to see him and his teachings reflected in his son, <i>Tata</i> Zwelidumile Josefa Dashe. 
    Newcomers have also come to learn about <i>Tata</i> George Dashe through his son. Today, TEAC holds its services on
    Sunday mornings as a testament to its evolving mission under the leadership of <i>Tata</i> Zwelidumile Josefa Dashe.</p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <p>Equally important, all who heed the teachings of TEAC have grown in their understanding of spirituality, deepening 
    their relationships with their angels. TEAC explores African spirituality by bridging the gap that once existed between 
    individuals and their celestial guardians, ultimately realizing true spiritual connection. 
    The Elects Apostolic Church serves as a refuge for those who are spiritually troubled, a home for the spiritually gifted, 
    and a hub of knowledge for those curious about the ways and beliefs of the past, fostering a community committed to rediscovering
    and embracing their spiritual heritage.</p>
